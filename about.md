title: About me 
---

I am a software engineer at [Voxeo - an Aspect Software Company](http://voxeo.com/), working on all things cloud and data. I have a B.S. in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Central Florida. When I'm not writing code or digging through a database, I enjoy tinkering with electronics (particularly playing with software defined radio), doing amateur astronomy research and data analysis, playing and watching basketball, gaming, working on my house, traveling, and spending time with my wonderful wife and two dogs.

TODO: the rest of this page :)
