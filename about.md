![](../assets/images/me.jpg)

I am a software engineer at [Aspect Cloud (formerly Voxeo)](http://voxeo.com/), working on all things cloud and 
data related. I have a B.S. in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Central 
Florida. When I'm not writing code or digging through a database, I enjoy tinkering with electronics (particularly 
playing with software defined radio), doing amateur astronomy research and data analysis, playing and watching 
basketball, gaming, working on my house, traveling, and spending time with my wonderful wife and two amazing dogs.
