I am currently working as an engineer at [Cyral][work]. I have a B.S. in Physics
with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Central
Florida. When I'm not writing code or digging through a database, I enjoy 
playing piano, playing golf, fly fishing, hiking, and enjoying the outdoors in 
general. I am an avid reader, and I love studying physics and cosmology.

I occasionally volunteer some amateur astronomy research at my alma mater UCF,
and continue to stay in touch with the scientific community. I enjoy mentoring
colleagues who are new to the industry, especially new grads. I've led technical
teams of various sizes, experience levels, and geographic regions, and I always
learn something new in the process.

Finally, the thing I value most in life is spending time with my wonderful 
family and friends.

My [PGP public key](/assets/misc/pgp_key.asc) fingerprint is
`F0B4 68E0 F0B2 AA1B 3D12 9576 AEC6 56A2 0FD9 1A0E`.
