I am currently working as a Senior Engineer at [Cyral](https://cyral.com/). I have a B.S. in Physics with minors in 
Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Central Florida. When I'm not writing code or digging through a 
database, I enjoy playing golf, fly fishing, hiking, and the outdoors in general. I'm also fond of chess, and do some 
light PC gaming in some of my free time. Oh, and I also collect watches. Honestly, I probably have too many hobbies to 
list!

I occasionally volunteer some amateur astronomy research at my alma mater UCF, and continue to stay in touch with the 
scientific community. I enjoy mentoring colleagues who are new to the industry, especially new grads. I've led technical
teams of various sizes, experience levels, and geographic regions, and I always learn something new in the process.

Finally, the thing I value most in life is spending time with my wonderful friends and family.

My [PGP public key](/assets/misc/pgp_key.asc) fingerprint is `F0B4 68E0 F0B2 AA1B 3D12 9576 AEC6 56A2 0FD9 1A0E`.
