I am a Technical Architect at [flexEngage](https://www.flexengage.com/). I have a B.S. in Physics with minors in 
Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Central Florida. When I'm not writing code or digging through a 
database, I enjoy playing golf, chess, hiking, gaming, tinkering with electronics (particularly playing with software 
defined radio), doing amateur astronomy research and data analysis, basketball, working on my house, traveling, and 
spending time with my wonderful family.

My [PGP public key](/assets/misc/pgp_key.asc) fingerprint is `F0B4 68E0 F0B2 AA1B 3D12 9576 AEC6 56A2 0FD9 1A0E`.
