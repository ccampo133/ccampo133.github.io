I am a Principal Engineer (a.k.a. Manager, Software Engineering) at [TE2](https://www.theexperienceengine.com/). I have 
a B.S. in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Central Florida. When I'm not 
writing code or digging through a database, I enjoy playing golf, hiking, tinkering with electronics (particularly 
playing with software defined radio), doing amateur astronomy research and data analysis, chess, basketball, gaming, 
working on my house, traveling, and spending time with my wonderful wife and daughter, two amazing dogs, and one special 
kitty.

My [PGP public key](/assets/misc/pgp_key.asc) fingerprint is `F0B4 68E0 F0B2 AA1B 3D12 9576 AEC6 56A2 0FD9 1A0E`.
