I am a senior software engineer at [Aspect Cloud (formerly Voxeo)](http://voxeo.com/),
working on all things cloud infrastructure related. I have a B.S. in Physics
with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Central
Florida. When I'm not writing code or digging through a database, I enjoy
tinkering with electronics (particularly playing with software defined radio),
doing amateur astronomy research and data analysis, playing and watching
basketball, gaming, working on my house, traveling, and spending time with my
wonderful wife and two amazing dogs.
