The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is unlike anything I've ever experienced before. While I've been self-isolating for the 
past ten days or so, I put together this simple, auto-updated website, with a few data visualizations: [https://covid19.ccampo.me](https://covid19.ccampo.me)

...or alternatively [https://www.ccampo.me/covid19-visualizations](https://www.ccampo.me/covid19-visualizations)

While not as robust or feature-packed as some of the excellent dashboards out there (e.g. [Worldometer][worldometer], 
[JHU][jhu], and [ncov2019.live][ncov2019]), the idea is to offer a quick glance at totals and a few tailored 
visualizations. The website is automatically updated every day at midnight GMT.

View the [GitHub repository][github] to view the code in more detail. Additionally, all historical data (previous 
updates) are included there. All contributions are welcome. I hope this website can be of help to somebody in these 
trying times.

We're all in this together. Stay healthy, stay safe, and we'll get through this eventually.

Best,
