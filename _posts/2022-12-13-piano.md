I started learning to play the piano on Christmas of 2022 and thus I am coming up on my one-year anniversary of starting
to play. It's been a very rewarding experience and I plan on continuing for the foreseeable future! Occasionally I upload
videos of my playing to a [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm0HPR2KRrKWWnfgZ_MWag3VBneqHW7Mt). 
Check it out if you are interested :).
