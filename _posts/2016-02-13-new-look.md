I refaced my website today, using a new [Jekyll 3.0][jekyll] enabled theme,
heavily based on the awesome [Centrarium][centrarium] theme by
[Ben Centra][bencentra]. After a few CSS tweaks, a new logo, and general
customization, I'm really happy with the end result. I'm sure I'll have some
more tweaks here and there, but for now, it's good to go. Thanks again Ben, this
is really great! As always, this site is fully open-source, and available on
[GitHub][github], so feel free to browse, clone, fork, star, or whatever!

In other news, I plan to be posting some neat stuff here in the near future, so
stick around!
