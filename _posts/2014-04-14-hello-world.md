Hello world! This is my first (but hopefully not last) blog post! My goal is to write about anything I find interesting,
helpful, and just plain cool. Oh, and space, definitely space. To stick with the programming theme, here's how to write
a Hello World program in Scala.

{% highlight scala %}
object HelloWorld extends App {
  println("Hello World!")
}
{% endhighlight %}
