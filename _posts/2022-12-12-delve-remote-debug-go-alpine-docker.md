Application"

I recently created a [simple example][gh] on how to enable remote debugging
using [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve)for a Go application running in
an Alpine Linux Docker container. This may be common knowledge in the Go
community, and your IDE and Delve's own documentation will show you how to
enable remote debugging for Go programs. However, I figured it would be nice to
see it packaged in a concise example, specifically using an Alpine Linux base. I
use a setup like this at work every day on the various applications I work on.
Hopefully somebody finds this helpful :).
